Project complete 19/mar

Features to play with in future? :

Difficult (i'm not sure how to do this)
- Let user toggle whether squares are black or multi-color
--> set a 'colormode' variable
Simple
- remove gaps between squares

???
- play with different mouseover events; can i get rid of gaps between drawn pixels (especially noticeable in larger grids) ?

i like this solution from another odin student: https://mahir-yadav.github.io/etch-a-sketch/
